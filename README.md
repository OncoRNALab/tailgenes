# tail gene analyses

This repository contains all data and scripts used to generate the numbers and figures for the tail gene part of the paper (currently on [BioRxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.12.06.519083v1)).

The `input` folder contains
- the `SupplTable1_sample_annotation.txt` file: sample information from the pan-cancer, three-cancer and lymphoma cohort (plasma samples)
- the `bladdercancer_sample_annotation.txt` file: sample information from the bladder cancer cohort (urine samples)
- `*_counts.txt`: raw HTSeq counts (mRNA transcripts summed at gene level) for the respective sample cohorts
- `*_normcounts(_all).txt`: DESeq2 library size normalized counts for the respective sample cohorts

The `data` folder contains files that are made using the scripts in the `data_analysis` folder:
- `*_biomarkertail_list.txt`: list of biomarker tail genes per set (generated by `tailgenes_*.R` script of respective cohort)
- `*_tailgenes.txt`: list of tail genes per sample with respective z-score and normalized counts (generated by `tailgenes_*.R` script of respective cohort)
- `*_zscores_tail.txt`: table containing the mRNA z-transformed abundance - based on mean and stdev of control reference - for every sample (generated by `tailgenes_*.R` script of respective cohort)

The `figures` folder contains plots that are made using the scripts in the `data_analysis` folder:
- `threecancer_(biomarker)tail_*.pdf`/`threecancer_(biomarker)tail_*.png`: figures generated by `tailgenes_threecancer.R` script of respective cohort
- `lymphoma_(biomarker)tail_*.pdf`/`lymphoma_(biomarker)tail_*.png`: figures generated by `tailgenes_lymphoma.R` script of respective cohort
- `bladdercancer_(biomarker)tail_*.pdf`/`bladdercancer_(biomarker)tail_*.png`: figures generated by `tailgenes_bladdercancer.R` script of respective cohort
