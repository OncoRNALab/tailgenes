# tail gene analyses

This repository contains all data and scripts used to generate the numbers and figures for the tail gene part of the paper by Morlion et al.

The `input` folder contains annotation and count data, used as input for data analysis:
- *SupplTable1_sample_annotation.txt*: pan-cancer, three-cancer and lymphoma cohort sample annotation (plasma samples)
- *bladdercancer_sample_annotation.txt*: bladder cancer cohort sample annotation (urine samples)
- *\*_counts.txt*: raw HTSeq counts (mRNA transcripts summed at gene level) for the respective sample cohort
- *\*_normcounts(_all).txt*: DESeq2 library size normalized counts for the respective sample cohort

The `data` folder contains files that are made using the scripts in the `data_analysis` folder:
- *\*_biomarkertail_list.txt*: list of biomarker tail genes per set for cohort \* (generated by `tailgenes_*.R` script)
- *\*_tailgenes.txt*: list of tail genes per sample of cohort \* with respective z-score and normalized counts (generated by `tailgenes_*.R` script)
- *\*_zscores_tail.txt*: table containing the mRNA z-transformed abundance - based on mean and stdev of control reference - for every sample of cohort \* (generated by `tailgenes_*.R` script)

The `figures` folder contains plots that are made using the scripts in the `data_analysis` folder:
- *threecancer_(biomarker)tail_\*.pdf* / *threecancer_(biomarker)tail_\*.png*: figures generated by `tailgenes_threecancer.R` script of respective cohort
- *lymphoma_(biomarker)tail_\*.pdf* / *lymphoma_(biomarker)tail_\*.png*: figures generated by `tailgenes_lymphoma.R` script of respective cohort
- *bladdercancer_(biomarker)tail_\*.pdf* / *bladdercancer_(biomarker)tail_\*.png*: figures generated by `tailgenes_bladdercancer.R` script of respective cohort
