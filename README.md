This repository contains data and scripts used to generate numbers and figures for the paper by Morlion et al.: *"Patient-specific alterations in blood plasma cfRNA profiles enable accurate classification of cancer patients and controls"* currently on [medRxiv](https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.05.24.23290388)

The `data_analysis` folder contains scripts to run differential abundance and tail gene analyses.  
The scripts can be run in R (v4.2.1) and RStudio, on any operating system and - depending on the input data - require several minutes to a few hours. Several R packages (listed below) are used in the scripts and these can be installed with Bioconductor:
```r
if (!require("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE))
  install.packages("BiocManager")
BiocManager::install("<name package>")
```
The following package versions were used for the analyses in the manuscript: 
biomarRt v2.62.0; caret v6.0.94; data.table v1.16.4; DESeq2 v1.36.0; EnhancedVolcano v1.24.0; fgsea v1.22.0; GeneOverlap v1.32.0; ggpubr v0.6.0; ggrepel v0.9.6; gridExtra v2.3; here v1.0.1; pheatmap v1.0.12; pROC v1.18.0; rstatix v0.7.2; tidyverse v1.3.2.

The `input` folder contains annotation and count data, used as input for scripts in the `data_analysis` folder:
- *SupplTable1_sample_annotation.txt*: pan-cancer, three-cancer, prostate cancer, non-malignant and lymphoma cohort sample annotation (plasma samples)
- *bladdercancer_sample_annotation.txt*: bladder cancer cohort sample annotation (urine samples)
- *\*_counts.txt*: raw counts (STAR+HTseq) for the respective sample cohort

The `data` folder contains files that are made using the scripts in the `data_analysis` folder:
- Differential abundance & GSEA files (generated by `differentialabundance.R` script):
  - folder *pancancer_GSEA* & *threecancer_GSEA* contain the fold change ranked gene lists per cancer vs control comparison in the respective cohorts - used as input for gene set enrichment analyses
  - *differentialabundance_\*.txt*: tables with differentially abundant genes (|log2(fold change)|>1 and adjusted p>0.05) per cancer-control comparison (cancertype) in the respective cohort \*
  - *\*_normcounts(_all).txt*: DESeq2 library size normalized counts for the respective sample cohort
    - for the prostate cancer cohort, only a file with normalized counts rounded to 9 digits was uploaded (*prostatecancer_normcounts_rounded.txt*) due to size restrictions
- Tail gene analyses (generated by `tailgenes_*.R` scripts):
  - *\*_biomarkertail_list.txt*: list of biomarker tail genes per set for cohort \*
  - *\*_tailgenes.txt*: list of tail genes per sample of cohort \* with respective z-score (based on all controls except sample itself) and normalized counts
  - overview_tailgenes.txt: table containing all tail genes with the number of samples for which they are tail gene, direction, and identify as biomarker tail gene

The `figures` folder contains plots that are made using the scripts in the `data_analysis` folder:
- *\*diffabundance_\*.pdf*: figures generated by `differentialabundance.Rmd` script
- *\*_PCA.pdf*: PCA figures generated by `differentialabundance.Rmd` script
- *threecancer_(biomarker)tail_\*.pdf* / *threecancer_(biomarker)tail_\*.png*: figures generated by `tailgenes_threecancer.Rmd` script of respective cohort
- *prostatecancer_(biomarker)tail_\*.pdf* / *prostatecancer_(biomarker)tail_\*.png*: figures generated by `tailgenes_prostatecancer.Rmd` script of respective cohort
- *lymphoma_(biomarker)tail_\*.pdf* / *lymphoma_(biomarker)tail_\*.png*: figures generated by `tailgenes_lymphoma.Rmd` script of respective cohort
- *bladdercancer_(biomarker)tail_\*.pdf* / *bladdercancer_(biomarker)tail_\*.png*: figures generated by `tailgenes_bladdercancer.Rmd` script of respective cohort
